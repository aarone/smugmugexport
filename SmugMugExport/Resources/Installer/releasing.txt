this is a mess

* increment version property 'Bundle versions string, short' in SmugMugExport-Info.plist
* cd SmugMugExport/Resources && ./bump-version.sh
* cd $PROJECT_HOME 
* xcodebuild
** should build the plugin in $PROJECT_HOME/build/Release
* open SmugMugExport/Resources/Installer/SmugMugExport.pkgproj
** use this to create an installer and open that file http://s.sudre.free.fr/Software/Packages/about.html
* 'build' in Packages
** creates an .mpkg artifact in SmugMugExport/Resources/Installer/build
* compress (right-click) the .mpkg file
* rename to match form SmugMugExport-1.0.13.zip replacing the version as necessary
* upload to S3
* update versionInfo.plist on S3 to point to the new version so that the in-app update mechanism will see that a new version is available for download.

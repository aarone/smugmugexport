#pragma mark -- MULTIPART POST DICTIONARIES

/*" Sets the values to use for a multipart POST operation. The values dictionary may include NSString, NSNumber, and NSData objects. NSString objects will automatically be converted to UTF8.

The method setPostDictionary: is similar, except that it encodes all of the form data into a single string that is sent along with the request. For example, given a dictionary such as:

{name = "Andrew Zamler-Carhart"; company = "KavaSoft"}

...setPostDictionary: will cause curl to send an HTTP request such as the following:

POST /form.php HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
name=Andrew+Zamler-Carhart&company=KavaSoft

Some web servers expect to receive form data in a multipart format, especially those that accept binary file uploads. Passing the same dictionary to this method will result in an HTTP request like the following:

POST /form.php HTTP/1.1
Expect: 100-continue
Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=curlf2RiuFIdRn36daIvycelja9wqMl

After the client receives a "HTTP/1.1 100 Continue" message, multipart data such as the following will be sent:

--curlf2RiuFIdRn36daIvycelja9wqMl
	Content-Disposition: form-data; name="name"

	Andrew Zamler-Carhart
--curlf2RiuFIdRn36daIvycelja9wqMl
	Content-Disposition: form-data; name="company"

	KavaSoft
--curlf2RiuFIdRn36daIvycelja9wqMl--

This method is based on sample code included in the libcurl guide:

http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/c/the-guide.html

The command-line utility tcpdump is useful for debugging HTTP transactions. You can monitor all traffic to and from the web server www.myserver.com using the following command:

	sudo tcpdump -Atq -s 0 host www.myserver.com
	"*/

- (void) setMultipartPostDictionary: (NSDictionary *) values {

}

/*" This method is like setMultipartPostDictionary:, but it allows you to specify custom headers for some of the values. It takes a dictionary of headers, using keys that match those in the values dictionary. Custom headers are optional, so you only need to supply key/value pairs for those form elements that require custom headers. If you don't need any custom headers at all, just pass nil or use the simpler method above.

For example, given these dictionaries as input:

values = {title = "Hello"; body = "<HTML><BODY>Hello, world!</BODY></HTML>"}
headers = {body = "Content-Type: text/html; filename = \"hello.html\""}

...the following data will sent to the HTTP server:

--curlf2RiuFIdRn36daIvycelja9wqMl
	Content-Disposition: form-data; name="title"

	Hello
--curlf2RiuFIdRn36daIvycelja9wqMl
	Content-Disposition: form-data; name="body"
				Content-Type: text/html; filename = "hello.html"
